# Pomodoro Timer ⏱️

## Description

A Pomodoro timer keeps you focused and productive by scheduling work and break sessions consecutively.

The clock is initialized with a 25-minute timer and a 5-minute break. Session and break lengths can be modified and an alarm sound will play at when the timer(s) end. 

A FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries project, with the objective to fulfill the user stories and get all of the tests to pass.

User Story #19: If the timer is running, the element with the id of time-left should display the remaining time in mm:ss format (decrementing by a value of 1 and updating the display every 1000ms).

User Story #20: If the timer is running and I click the element with id="start_stop", the countdown should pause.

User Story #21: If the timer is paused and I click the element with id="start_stop", the countdown should resume running from the point at which it was paused.
